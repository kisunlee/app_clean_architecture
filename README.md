# Overview of Clean Architecture with MVVM in Flutter

	•	Layered Structure: The app is divided into three main layers:
	•	Presentation Layer: Contains UI components (Views) and ViewModels. Views are responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions, while ViewModels manage UI state and business logic, exposing data and commands to the Views.
	•	Domain Layer: Houses core business logic, use cases, and entities. This layer is independent of external frameworks and focuses on the application’s rules and operations.
	•	Data Layer: Manages data sources, repositories, and models. It handles data retrieval from remote APIs, local databases, and other sources, providing data to the Domain Layer.
	•	MVVM Pattern:
	•	Model: Represents the data and business logic, including data models, repository classes, and utility functions.
	•	View: Flutter widgets that display the UI. Views are kept free of business logic and rely on ViewModels for data and state updates.
	•	ViewModel: Acts as a bridge between the View and Model, processing user input, managing state, and exposing data to the View. ViewModels also provide commands for the View to trigger business logic without knowing its implementation.
	•	State Management: Libraries like Provider, GetX, or Bloc are commonly used for managing state and dependency injection, ensuring a reactive and maintainable architecture.
	•	Cross-Platform Support: By adhering to Clean Architecture and MVVM, the app’s core logic is decoupled from platform-specific code, enabling seamless deployment to iOS, Android, and Windows with consistent behavior and UI.
